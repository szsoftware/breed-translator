This silly browser extension translates chinese strings within the Breed Bootloader for various wifi devices.

## Credits
### Breed Bootloader
Before all, credits goes to the developer of "Breed Bootloader", hackpascal:
http://breed.hackpascal.net/.  
I hope some day I will find the sources of Breed (Or at least the UI-part) within https://github.com/hackpascal ;-)
to prevent such a silly and dumb method for i18n like this.

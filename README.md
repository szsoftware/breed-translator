# What is breed-translator?
This silly browser extension translates Chinese strings in the web recovery console of BREED Bootloader.

# What is BREED?
BREED stands for Boot and Recovery Environment for Embedded Devices. It is a bootloader with WebUI for flashing/dumping firmware/EEPROM and overclocking your wireless router/access point. It is very useful to save you from soldering/flash programmer/TTL if you flashed a wrong firmware or corrupted the firmware.

# Why don't I use online translators?
When your router is in bootloader mode, the WAN/internet port doesn't work. Don't expect you can use online translator unless you have another router and a dual LAN/WLAN computer. Btw, the result of online translator can be confusing.

## Breed Bootloader
Before all, credits goes to the developer of "Breed Bootloader", hackpascal:

I hope some day I will find the sources of Breed (Or at least the UI-part) within https://github.com/hackpascal ;-)
to prevent such a silly and dumb method for i18n like this.
